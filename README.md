# CML-StrategicDesign-Addon
An adapted CML-Project which extends the exisitng grammar with missing strategic design patterns.

# Whatâ€™s included
Context-map additions:
- Separate Ways relationship.
- Big Ball of Mud annotation.
  
Distillation patterns:
- Highlighted Core
- Segregated Core
- Abstract COre
- Cohesive Mechansims


# Why
Strategic decisions are often tacit. These extensions encode them directly in the model to improve trasnparency, comprehension, and evolution across teams.
The inclusion of the new strategic DDD-patterns is optional (and accordingly implemented in the code).

# License
Apache-2.0 (aligned with upstream CML).
