# CML-StrategicDesign-Addon
An adapted CML-Project which extends the exisitng grammar with missing strategic design patterns.

# Whatâ€™s included
Context-map additions:
- Separate Ways relationship.
- Big Ball of Mud annotation.
  
Distillation patterns:
- Highlighted Core
- Segregated Core
- Abstract Core
- Cohesive Mechansims

# Why
Strategic decisions are often tacit. These extensions encode some of them directly in the model to improve trasnparency, comprehension, and evolution across teams.
The inclusion of the new strategic DDD-patterns is optional (and accordingly implemented in the code).
